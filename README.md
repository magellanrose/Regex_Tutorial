# Regex Tutorial

Regex, short for regular expression, is a powerful tool for creating patterns that enable the identification, location, and manipulation of text. In applications like the VS Code text editor, where you search for specific words or numbers using Ctrl + F, you can leverage regex by selecting the .* button on the right-hand side. This functionality allows for more flexible and sophisticated text searches based on user-defined patterns. To illustrate, let's delve into a detailed example to better understand how regex works.
